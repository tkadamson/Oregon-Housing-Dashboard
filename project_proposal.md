## Project Proposal

For this project we want to use American Community Survey Data to explore the correlation of a variety of metrics.

For visulaizations, we want to create scatterplots representing the user's chosen metrics (we'll limit their options to 5-10 in a dropdown) and choropleth across the states. We'll explore other options as we go.

For the choropleth, we'll use Highcharts pre-generated geoJSON file. For the pther metrics, we'll load them into a Mongo Database added into the geoJSON file in the properties section to keep everything in one place.

#### Timeline

By next class, each group member will come back with 2-3 metics from the ACS they want to focus on. After that, we'll work to narrow and clean the data.
